# RASP: Real-Time Analytical Stream Processing

RASP is a distributed system that allows the execution of low latency SQL queries that join a real-time network data stream, generated by sampling Internet Exchange Point traffic, and external datasets containing Autonomous System and Domain Name information.

RASP demonstrates the following key features:
* Allows the execution of low latency real-time queries: SQL queries are performed on real-time data with minimal latency.
* Is scalabe: RASP uses distributed technologies (Kafka, Storm, HDFS, HBase, Phoenix).
* Is fault-tolerant: RASP uses a combination of technologies that provide fault tolerance.
* Is extensible: Extending the functionality of the system for a new external dataset is simple.
