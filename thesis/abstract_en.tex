In this thesis, we design and implement a distributed system that allows the execution of low latency SQL queries that join a real-time data stream and an external dataset. The use case for which we implement this system is the execution of topN SQL queries that join a real-time network data stream, generated by sampling IXP traffic, and external datasets containing Autonomous System and DNS information. 

To achieve low query latency, the join is performed in real time using the Storm processing framework and the denormalized data stream is stored at a Phoenix table, allowing all subsequent queries to be performed without the need to compute the join on query time. The system utilizes distributed technologies such as Kafka, Storm and HBase, which ensure its scalability and fault tolerance. Moreover, Storm provides extesibility to the system, allowing us to easily add more external datasets of any size that are joined with the network data stream.

We also apply a combination of optimizations to the HBase cluster and the Phoenix table that further reduce query latency. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the system for various parameters while tuning and applying optimizations, and experiment with the system's scalability.
