\section{Motivation}

test\cite{geolite}

increasing volume of IP traffic

IXP traffic can provide insight about the whole internet

processing big data made possible with distributed frameworks


\section{Objectives}

The goal of thesis is to design and implement a system that allows the execution of SQL queries that join a real-time data stream and an external dataset.

scalability, fault tolerence, extensibility, low latency

our use case is network data, but can be modified for different datasets

the external datasets can be of any size

explain IXP network data usecase


\section{Thesis Outline}

In Chapter \ref{chapter:theory} we provide the necessary theoretical background so that the reader can familiarize themselves with the frameworks and technologies used in in the thesis. More specifically, we present the characteristics, architecture and key concepts of Kafka, Storm, HDFS, HBase and Phoenix.
